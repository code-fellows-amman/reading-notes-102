# Learning Markdown

Github uses special formats for forms that can be created using markdown, which is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax. basically markdown is a way to style text on the web, like using bold, italic, adding images etc... it is mostly text with some no-alphabetic characters # * - to name a few. it is used in Github at gists, comments and pull requests, and files with .md extension. 

Headers are created by adding the # character before the header, one # means h1 text, two ## means h2 and so on, the higher the h count the smaller the text, making text *italic* is achieved by wrapping the text with a 1 * or _, **Bold** by using ** or __, ***Both*** with (you guessed it) *** or ___. to check all the markdown syntax [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is the place to go. 

## Github Pages

GH Pages lets you turn your repos into elegant websites to showcase, documentation, projects etc.. no databases and servers needed, it works by creating a URL, to your repo, by looking for web content, to create github pages in a separate branch, all this is done with the help of [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
